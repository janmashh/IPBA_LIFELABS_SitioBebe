          People are losing their loved ones as they die due to COVID-19, Parents working at home to gain the money they need for their children,<br>
          Homeless people not knowing where they can go due to the fact that they have no shelter nor money to buy shelter and more of their needs. </p>

          <p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Though a lot of people are helping in Quezon City, Pasig, Baguio, Cebu and so on, what about a place in Pampanga?<br>
            Have you heard of the Sitio Bebe Barangay? Let’s talk about what is happening in Sitio Bebe.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size:25px; letter-spacing:1px">About Sitio Bebe</h2>
   </div class="title"> 
   <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Sitio Bebe is located in Pampanga and right now they are having some major difficulties due to obviously the Pandemic or COVID-19.<br>
    Though why are they having a hard time? Let’s dig in more information.</p>

   <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Kuya Tami from Brgy. Sitio Bebe, He has to gather water from the well and boil the water for he or the people in Sitio Bebe to drink clean water. </p>
   <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Though the people in Sitio Bebe are still having a hard time due to the fact that they are also going through a severe health crisis.<br>
     Sitio Bebe isn’t close to a natural waterway or canal, the (local) government often imports water to the people in Sitio Bebe or send them to water wells,<br>
     though because of this, drought often happens especially in the summer.</p>
     <a name="planning"></a>
     <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Most of the people in Sitio Bebe work either in the factory or in caves to mine which has a disadvantage, they lack medical help <br> 
      or Sitio Bebe barely has health professionals (e.g. Doctor/s, Nurses & etc.), so most of the people in Sitio Bebe get sick <br>
     which is sad to see. Their situation gets even worse due to COVID-19 and this is why we, Main IV, are here to help. </p>

     </div class="presentation">
     <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Before the fundraising concert, we have to first prepare our materials for a smooth start. Setting goals and procedures may help us determine <br>
       our intention and also ideas for the specific event. For our main agenda or purposes of the fundraising event will be the system where an area <br>
       inside Pampanga named Sitio Bebe is currently having problems regarding their scarcity and shortage, to offer our assistance we were assigned <br>
       to make a fundraising event concert which leads us to collect funds for them. To start our Pre-concert we, the organizers have to determine volunteers, <br>
       place, materials, details of the concert itself, and the program flow. </p>
       <p style="font-family:sans-serif">During the Fundraising Concert, hosts of the event will do the opening remarks and welcoming sponsors and will also talk about the <br>
         purpose of the Fundraising Concert which is obviously to help Sitio Bebe. Musicians will be performing from 3pm to 9pm, <br> 
         the names are listed above (the link). 10pm will be the end of the Fundraising Concert.</p>
         <p style="font-family:sans-serif">After the Fundraising Concert, we will talk about the steps necessary to distribute the proceeds to the residents of Sitio Bebe, <br>
          as well as the fundraising concert’s expenses and the needs of Sitio Bebe.</p>

          <p style="font-family:sans-serif">Our group chose Educational Video/s considering the fact that they could be aware of what is happening in a certain area <br>
           while also being educated on how to spread awareness and/or how to help the citizens or people in Sitio Bebe.</p>
